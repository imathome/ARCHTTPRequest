About this functionality

As many ppl are aware (in the ios space) ASIHTTPRequest is an outstanding piece of code used by alot of people. Unfortunately for us,
the creator of the Library (rightly imho) decided to cease continuation of the project due to a number of reasons.

In the (vain) attempt i can even help, i created this simple HTTP facility to query the backend server using a mechanism similar
to that used by ASIHTTP to assure some degree of continuation.

Its no-where near as detailed as ASI nor is it intended to be (at this point).

All the best,
